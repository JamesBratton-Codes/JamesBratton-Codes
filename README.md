# Hey there 👋 I'm James

I'm a hands-on problem solver who builds small, creative tools to fix real-world problems—especially the weird, annoying ones no one else wants to deal with.

Most of what you'll find here started with a simple idea like:  
**“There’s gotta be a better way to do this.”**  
So I built one.

### 🧰 What I Do

- 🧠 Tinker with scripts and automations to save time and stay organized
- 🧰 Build little tools that solve annoying tech problems
- 🧪 Experiment with new tech just for fun (and sometimes to prove a point)
- 🛠️ Learn by making—and break stuff along the way

Whether it’s a Python script to clean up data, a shell command to speed up a repetitive task, or a wild idea I wanted to test—if it solves a problem, it ends up here.

### 🗂️ Projects You Might Like

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| 📁 Auto_network_map | A script set up to auto-detect and map out network devices. |

(Yeah, there’s more. I experiment a lot. Stuff shows up here when it works—or breaks in fun ways.)

`Python` ‧ `Bash` ‧ `Linux` ‧ `Automation` ‧ `Markdown` ‧ `Git` ‧ `Creative Debugging`
